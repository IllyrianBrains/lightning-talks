# Lightning-Talks ⚡ at IB-Tech

*Lightning-Talks ⚡* (Prezantimet Rrufe) at IllyrianBrains-Tech are a possibility for one to share their story, their preferred tool, or an interesting bug/feature they came accross. The topic is picked by the presenter, and added to one of the projects at our github repository:

### About

This book can be found at https://github.com/IllyrianBrainsTech/lightning-talks. It is built by [Jupyter-Book](https://jupyterbook.org/en/stable/intro.html), and it can be extended using markdown files, jupyter slides, or jupyter-notebooks for executable code in case of live-examples. More information to be shared soon.
